STEP 1: UNDERSTANDING SAAS AND ZOHO CREATOR 
What is SaaS? 
• SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) apps run in the cloud—you use 
them via a browser, no installation needed. 
• Examples: Gmail, Google Docs, Office 365, Zoho Creator. 
• What is Zoho Creator? 
• A “low-code” platform to build cloud apps quickly using 
forms, drag-and-drop tools, and simple logic. 
ACTION: 
Spend 10 minutes reading about SaaS and Zoho Creator basics on 
their respective sites. 
STEP 2: CREATE YOUR ZOHO CREATOR ACCOUNT 
1. Go to Zoho Creator. 
2. Click Sign Up (top right). 
3. Enter your email, create a password, and complete signup. 
4. You may need to verify your email—check your inbox. 
5. After signup, click Sign In and log in to your new Zoho Creator 
account.

 STEP 3: START A NEW APPLICATION 
1. After login, you’re on the Zoho Creator Dashboard (it looks 
empty if it’s your first time). 
2. Click Create New Application (button or big ‘+’ icon). 
3. Select Create from Scratch (don’t use a template this time—
 you’ll learn more this way). 
4. When prompted, name your app Student Course 
Management. 
5. (Optional) Choose an icon and color for your app for easy 
identification. 
6. Click Create or Continue to enter the app builder. 
STEP 4: DESIGN THE DATA MODEL BY CREATING FORMS 
In Zoho Creator, a Form = a Table in a database. Each form holds 
one kind of data. 
4.1. Create the “Students” Form 
• Click + New Form. 
• Name it “Students.” 
• Add these fields (drag from left panel): 
• Student Name (Single Line) 
• Roll Number (Single Line) 
• Email (Email type) 
• Department (Dropdown; add options like CSE, IT, ECE, 
etc.) 
• Click Done or Save. 
4.2. CREATE THE “COURSES” FORM 
• Again, click + New Form. 
• Name it “Courses.” 
• Add: 
• Course Name (Single Line) 
• Course Code (Single Line)

 • Instructor (Single Line) 
• Semester (Dropdown; options: 1, 2, 3, 4, etc.) 
• Save the form. 
4.3. CREATE THE “ENROLLMENTS” FORM 
• Click + New Form one more time. 
• Name it “Enrollments.” 
• Add: 
• Student (Lookup field; look up from “Students”) 
• Course (Lookup field; look up from “Courses”) 
• Enrollment Date (Date type) 
• Feedback (Multi Line or use a “Rating” field if available) 
• Save the form. 
• (Tip: Lookup fields link forms—this is fundamental in cloud 
data modeling.) 
STEP 5: ADD DATA VALIDATION 
• For Email, choose the “Email” field type for automatic 
validation. 
• For Roll Number (Students) and Course Code (Courses): 
• Click the field in the form builder. 
• Enable “Unique” to prevent duplicates. 
Why? 
This avoids errors and ensures each student/course is only created 
once. 
STEP 6: CREATE REPORTS (TO VIEW DATA) 
• Each form creates a default report (table of all records). 
• To view: In the builder, click the “Reports” tab under each 
form. 
• Try creating a custom report: 
• Click Add Report. 
• Select a form, pick “List” or “Summary” view.

 • Experiment with sorting/filtering (e.g., show enrollments 
per course). 
STEP 7: AUTOMATE TASKS WITH WORKFLOWS 
7.1. Send Confirmation Email after Enrollment 
• Select the “Enrollments” form. 
• Go to Workflows > On Success > Add Action > Send Email. 
• In “To,” choose the Student’s Email field. 
• Write a message (“Thank you for enrolling in...”). 
• 7.2. Alert on Low Feedback 
• In the same “Enrollments” workflow, add a condition: 
• If Feedback (say, less than 3/5), trigger an alert or email to 
Instructor. 
• Use simple drag-and-drop or select ready-made actions. 
STEP 8: SET UP USER ROLES & ACCESS 
• Go to Settings > Users & Permissions. 
• Add user roles: 
• Admin: Full access. 
• Instructor: View courses, enrollments, feedback. 
• Student: View only their enrollments. 
• Assign forms and reports to roles—control who can “View,” 
“Add,” or “Edit.” 
STEP 9: TEST YOUR APPLICATION 
• Use the Preview feature. 
• Enter sample data in Students/Courses, then make an 
Enrollment. 
• Submit feedback, and check if emails or alerts work. 
• Try logging in as another role (Instructor/Student) to 
experience access control.

 STEP 10: DEPLOY AND SHARE 
• Click Access this Application (top right). 
• Use “Share” or “Add Users”—enter classmates’ emails and 
assign a role. 
• Your app is now live on the cloud—accessible from anywhere, 
at any time! 
STEP 11: GATHER FEEDBACK AND IMPROVE 
• Ask users (friends, classmates, or faculty) to use your app. 
• Tweak forms, user roles, and automations based on feedback. 
• Document your process and challenges for your assignment/
 report.
